# Police Station Management System

Welcome to the Police Station Management System project, a Java-based application designed to streamline the operations of a police station using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This system offers a range of features to effectively manage various aspects of police station operations, including:

1. Register/Update FIR: Record and update First Information Reports (FIR) for criminal cases filed at the police station.

2. Register/Update Civil Complain: Document and update civil complaints filed by citizens for non-criminal issues.

3. Add/Remove Staff: Manage the addition and removal of staff members, including police officers, administrative personnel, and support staff.

4. View FIR: Access and review registered FIRs along with associated details such as case type, status, and assigned officers.

5. View Complain: Review registered civil complaints, including complainant details and complaint status.

6. View Staff: View a list of all staff members currently employed at the police station.

7. View Report: Generate and view reports summarizing various aspects of police station activities, including case statistics, staff performance, and resource utilization.


## Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language used for implementing the system.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are leveraged for designing modular and maintainable code.

IntelliJ IDEA: We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing and executing the program. IntelliJ IDEA offers a rich set of features, including intelligent code completion, debugging tools, and seamless integration with Java development tools, which can significantly enhance the development experience and improve program execution.
